[.lead]
The Astra REST API is defined by how HTTP and the related parameters are used to act on the resources. The details of the Astra HTTP implementation are presented below.

== API transactions and the CRUD model

The Astra REST API implements a transactional model with well-defined operations and state transitions.

===== Request and response API transaction

Every REST API call is performed as an HTTP request to the Astra service. Each request generates an associated response back to the client. This request-response pair can be considered to be an API transaction.

===== Support for CRUD operational model

Each of the resource instances and collections available through the ONTAP REST API is accessed based on the CRUD model. There are four primary operations, each of which maps to a single HTTP method. The operations include:

* Create
* Read
* Update
* Delete

For some of the Astra resources, only a subset of these operations is supported. You should review the link:../reference/api_reference.html[API reference] for more information about a specific API call.

== HTTP methods

The HTTP methods or verbs supported by the API are presented in the table below.

[cols="15,15,70"*,options="header"]
|===
|Method
|CRUD
|Description

|GET
|Read
|Retrieves object properties for a resource instance or collection. This is considered a *list* operation when used with a collection.

|POST
|Create
|Creates a new resource instance based on the input parameters. The long-term URL is returned in a `Location` response header.

|PUT
|Update
|Updates an entire resource instance with the supplied JSON request body. Key values that are not user modifiable are preserved.

|DELETE
|Delete
|Deletes an existing resource instance.

|HEAD
|Read
|Essentially issues a GET request but only returns the HTTP response headers.

|OPTIONS
|Read
|Used to determine what HTTP methods are supported at a specific REST endpoint.

|xxx

|If-Modified-Since
|Request

|Location
|Response
|Contains the full URL of the newly created resource.

=== Query parameters

The following query parameters are available for use with the Astra REST API.

// got from oav_v1.py -o top-c1

[IMPORTANT]
The query parameter `continue` is defined in the OpenAPI file, but never used. So I have not included it.

[cols="20,80"*,options="header"]
|===
|Query parameter
|Description
|include
|Contains the fields that should be returned when reading a collection.
|filter
|Indicates the fields that must match for a resource to be returned when reading a collection.
|orderBy
|Determines the sort order of resources returned when reading a collection.
|limit
|Limits the maximum number of resources returned when reading a collection.
|skip
|Sets the number of resources to pass over and skip when reading a collection.
|count
|Indicates if the total number of resources should be returned in the metadata object.
|===

=== HTTP status codes

The HTTP status codes used by the Astra REST API are described below.

[NOTE]
The Astra REST API also uses the *Problem Details for HTTP APIs* standard. See link:diagnostics_support.html[Diagnostics and support] for more information.

[cols="15,20,65"*,options="header"]
|===
|Code
|Meaning
|Description

|200
|OK
