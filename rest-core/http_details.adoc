[.lead]
The Astra REST API is defined in terms of how HTTP and the related parameters are used to operate on resource instances and collections. The details of how HTTP is used with the Astra API are presented below.

== API transaction and the CRUD model

The Astra REST API implements a transactional model with well-defined operations and state transitions.

===== Request and response API transaction

Every REST API call is performed as an HTTP request to the ONTAP system which generates an associated response to the client. This request/response pair is considered an API transaction. Before using the API, you should be familiar with the input variables available to control a request and the contents of the response output.

===== Support for CRUD operations

Each of the resources available through the ONTAP REST API is accessed based on the CRUD model:

* Create
* Read
* Update
* Delete

For some of the Astra resources, only a subset of the operations is supported. You should review the link:../reference/api_reference.html[API reference] for more information.

== Format of the URL

xxx


=== HTTP methods

The HTTP methods or verbs supported by the API are presented in the table below.

[NOTE]
See link:../object-model/url_format.html[URL format for API access] for more information about the format of the URL.

[cols="15,15,70"*,options="header"]
|===
|Method
|CRUD
|Description
|GET
|Read
|Retrieves object properties for a resource instance or collection. This is considered a *list* operation when used with a collection.
|POST
|Create
|Creates a new resource instance based on the input parameters. The long-term URL is returned in a `Location` response header.
|PUT
|Update
|Updates an entire resource instance with the supplied JSON request body. Key values that are not user modifiable are preserved.
|DELETE
|Delete
|Deletes an existing resource instance.
|HEAD
|Read
|Essentially issues a GET request but only returns the HTTP response headers.
|OPTIONS
|Read
|Used to determine what HTTP methods are supported at a specific REST endpoint.

=== Query parameters

The following query parameters are available for use with the Astra REST API.

// got from oav_v1.py -o top-c1

[IMPORTANT]
The query parameter `continue` is defined in the OpenAPI file, but never used. So I have not included it.

[cols="20,80"*,options="header"]
|===
|Query parameter
|Description
|include
|Contains the fields that should be returned when reading a collection.
|filter
|Indicates the fields that must match for a resource to be returned when reading a collection.
|orderBy
|Determines the sort order of resources returned when reading a collection.
|limit
|Limits the maximum number of resources returned when reading a collection.
|skip
|Sets the number of resources to pass over and skip when reading a collection.
|count
|Indicates if the total number of resources should be returned in the metadata object.
|===

=== HTTP status codes

The HTTP status codes used by the Astra REST API are described below.

[NOTE]
The Astra REST API also uses the *Problem Details for HTTP APIs* standard. See link:diagnostics_support.html[Diagnostics and support] for more information.

[cols="15,20,65"*,options="header"]

|Code
|Meaning
|Description

|200
|OK
