The Astra REST API is composed of several smaller APIs. Each API provides access to a primary object through one or more REST endpoints. This section provides a concise overview of the APIs comprising the Astra REST API. This detailed introduction is valuable as part of planning an automation deployment.

For the complete description of the Astra REST API including HTTP methods, parameters, and status codes, see link:../reference/api_reference.html[API reference]. For practical examples of making API calls using Curl, see link:../workflows/workflows.html[Administrative workflows].
