The Astra REST API is composed of several smaller APIs, each providing access to a primary resource type through one or more REST endpoints. This section provides a concise description of these APIs, which is useful as part of planning an Astra automation deployment.

For a complete description of the Astra REST API including the individual endpoints, parameters, and status codes, see link:../reference/api_reference.html[API reference]. For practical examples of making API calls to perform common administrative tasks, see link:../workflows/workflows.html[Administrative workflows].
