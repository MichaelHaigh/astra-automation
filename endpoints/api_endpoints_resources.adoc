The Astra REST API is composed of several smaller APIs, each providing access to a primary resource type through one or more REST endpoints. This section provides a concise overview of the APIs contained in the Astra REST API, which is useful as part of planning an automation deployment.

For a complete description of the Astra REST API including the endpoints, HTTP methods, parameters, and status codes, see link:../reference/api_reference.html[API reference]. For practical examples of how to make API calls using Curl, see link:../workflows/workflows.html[Administrative workflows].
