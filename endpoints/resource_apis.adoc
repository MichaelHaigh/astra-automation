The Astra REST API is composed of several smaller APIs, each providing access to a specific resource type through one or more REST endpoints. This section provides a concise description of these APIs, which is useful as part of planning an Astra automation deployment.

For a more complete description of the Astra REST API, including the endpoints, input parameters, and status codes, see link:../reference/api_reference.html[API reference]. And or practical examples of making API calls to perform common administrative tasks, see link:../workflows/workflows.html[Administrative workflows].
