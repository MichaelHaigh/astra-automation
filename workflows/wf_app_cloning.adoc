These workflow describe how to clone and restore your managed applications.

===== Cloning an app

Here are a few things to consider when cloning a managed application.

Source cluster identifier::
The value of `sourceClusterId` always identifies the cluster where the original app is running.

Cluster identifier::
The value of `clusterId` always identifies the target cluster where the new app will run.

* When cloning within the same cluster, `clusterID` and `sourceClusterId` are the same.
* When cloning across clusters, `clusterId` must be the ID of the target cluster.
