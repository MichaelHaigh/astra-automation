[.lead]
You should always remove a cluster from Astra before deleting it in the cloud provider. If you delete it in the cloud provider first, the cluster can become unresponsive and unusable in Astra. In this case you can manually remove it using the workflow described below.

[IMPORTANT]
The workflows Hadrian provided use the endpoint `managedClusters` which is not yet available in the REST API.

////
GET /k8s/v1/managedApps?include=id%2Cname%2CmanagedState%2Cstate
# For apps that are removed:
GET /managedClusters/{id}
# Grab cluster UUID
DELETE /k8s/v1/managedApps/{id}
DELETE /managedClusters/{id}
