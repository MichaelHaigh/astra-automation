The Astra REST API provides multiple layers of security.

==== Astra API tokens

To use the Astra REST API, you must provide an API token on every request in the `Authorization` request header. Note the following:

* You can generate an API token at the Astra web user interface.
* A token never expires after it is created.
* You can revoke a token at any time at the Astra web user interface.

See link:getting_api_token.html[Getting an API token] for more information.

==== Roles and access control

Each Astra user is assigned to a single role. The role is used to restrict access to the API calls. The defined roles include:

* Owner
* Admin
* Member
* Viewer
* SRE

==== TLS protection for network connections

All HTTP network traffic is protected using transport layer security (TLS) standard.
