The common Astra workflows can be used with both Astra Control deployment models. They are organized in different categories to make it easier to locate the one you want.

[NOTE]
Before using any of the Astra REST API workflows, make sure to review link:../get-started/prepare_to_use_workflows.html[Prepare to use the workflows].
