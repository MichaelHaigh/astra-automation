There are several Kubernetes concepts that are relevant to using the Astra REST API.

=== Objects

The objects maintained within a Kubernetes environment are persistent entities representing the cluster. These objects describe the state of the system including the cluster workload.

=== Namespaces

Namespaces provide a technique for isolating resources within a single cluster. This organizational structure is when dividing the types of work, users, and resources. Objects with a namespace scope need to be unique within the namespace, while those with a cluster scope must be unique across the entire cluster.

=== Labels

Labels can be associated with Kubernetes objects. They describe attributes as key-value pairs and can be used to enforce an arbitrary organization which is generally useful to the organization but outside the core Kubernetes operation.
