[.lead]
You can issue a simple command at your workstationâ€™s CLI to get started using the Astra REST API and confirm its availability.

[NOTE]
The example provided below is very simple. The administrative workflow samples later in this guide use a more robust format.

.Before you begin

You must have the Curl utility available on your local workstation. Also generate a token and retrieve the account identifier as described in the task link:get_api_token.html[Getting an API access token].

.Curl example

The following Curl command retrieves a list of Astra users.

[source,curl]
curl --location --request GET 'https://astra.netapp.io/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/core/v1/users' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>'
